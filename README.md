# Connected-picture-generation-TOY-APP
Connected picture generation TOY APP is an app that allows user to generate and connect pictures just with a prompt using stable diffusion model from hugging face.
- Provide two images and a prompt as an input
- Press Generate and then see the magic

> This repository contains the following files:
